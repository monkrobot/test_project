#There is a CSV file with raw data of user’s requests to a server for one day. https://drive.google.com/file/d/0B8K6jIyGsfV-VGs1VkU1cnJ0NUk/view?usp=sharing
#Each request has timestamp(ts), api name(api_name) , http method(mtd) and response http code(cod).
#You need to implement two scripts using Python.
#First script should generate a metric and upload it to MySQL DB from this raw data.
#Metric description:
#Count of response with 5xx http code for each api_name*http_method pair for each 15 min.
#SQL table should have following fields:
#timeframe_start, api_name, http_method, count_http_code_5xx, is_anomaly
#Second one should find, and mark anomaly metric based on its statistic distribution.
#Anomaly detection algorithm:
#Assume that the metric for each api_name*http_method pair belongs to normal distribution,
#If value of metric is outside of plus 3th-sigma (3σ) range, mark value as anomaly.
#Please upload description and scripts to GitHub and provide a link to us.

df = pd.read_csv('raw_data.csv', sep=',')
